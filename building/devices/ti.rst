Texas Instruments SoCs
======================
The instructions here will tell how to run OP-TEE on Texas Instruments devices.
Secure TI devices require a boot image that is authenticated by ROM code to
function. Without this, even JTAG remains locked. In order to create a valid
boot image for a secure device from TI, the initial public software image must
be signed and combined with various headers, certificates, and other binary
images.

Information on the details on the complete boot image format can be obtained
from Texas Instruments. The tools used to generate boot images for secure
devices are part of a secure development package (SECDEV) that can be downloaded
from:

	http://www.ti.com/mysecuresoftware (login required)

The secure development package is access controlled due to NDA and export
control restrictions. Access must be requested and granted by TI before the
package is viewable and downloadable. Contact TI, either online or by way of a
local TI representative, to request access.

Regular build
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Start out by following the :ref:`get_and_build_the_solution` as described in
:ref:`build`. Stop before the section on flashing the device, this is currently
not supported automatically.

Booting the device
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SD Card boot
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Create two partitions on an SD card, ``boot`` of type ``FAT16`` and ``rootfs``
of type ``EXT4``. To prevent accidental data loss we do not attempt this
automatically (the RPI3 :ref:`rpi3_build_instructions` use a similar SD card
layout, you can refer to that page for details).

Extract the generated rootfs to the ``rootfs`` partition

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd <SD card rootfs partition>
    $ gunzip -cd <repo directory>/gen_rootfs/filesystem.cpio.gz | sudo cpio -idm

Add the bootloader to the ``boot`` partition

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd <SD card boot partition>
    $ cp <repo directory>/u-boot/u-boot-spl_HS_MLO MLO
    $ cp <repo directory>/u-boot/u-boot_HS.img u-boot.img
