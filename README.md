# OP-TEE documentation
This is official documentation for the OP-TEE project. Before OP-TEE v3.5.0 it
used to be spread across all different OP-TEE gits making up the OP-TEE project
as well as optee.org. But starting with OP-TEE v3.5.0 we have gathered all
documentation at single place (i.e., this git).

Even though GitHub renders `*.rst` somewhat OK, you are not suppossed to browse
the documentation there/here. Instead you should go to [optee.readthedocs.io],
where you will find the complete documentation rendered using Sphinx.
