GlobalPlatform API
==================

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^
GlobalPlatform_ works across industries to identify, develop and publish
specifications which facilitate the secure and interoperable deployment and
management of multiple embedded applications on secure chip technology. OP-TEE
has support for GlobalPlatform TEE Client API Specification_ v1.0 (GPD_SPE_007)
and TEE Internal Core API Specification v1.1.2 (GPD_SPE_010).

.. _tee_client_api:

TEE Client API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The TEE Client API describes and defines how a client running in a rich
operating environment (REE) should communicate with the TEE. To identify a
Trusted Application (TA) to be used, the client provides an UUID_. All TA's
exposes one or several functions. Those functions corresponds to a so called
``commandID`` which also is sent by the client. 

TEE Contexts
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The TEE Context is used for creating a logical connection between the client
and the TEE. The context must be initialized before the TEE Session can be
created. When the client has completed a jobs running in secure world, it
should finalize the context and thereby also releasing resources.

TEE Sessions
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sessions are used to create logical connections between a client and a specific
Trusted Application. When the session has been established the client have a
opened up the communication channel towards the specified Trusted Application
identified by the ``UUID``. At this stage the client and the Trusted
Application can start to exchange data.


TEE Client API example / usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Below you will find the main functions as defined by GlobalPlatform and which
are used in the communication between the client and the TEE.

.. code-block:: c

    TEEC_Result TEEC_InitializeContext(
    	const char* name,
    	TEEC_Context* context)
    
    void TEEC_FinalizeContext(
    	TEEC_Context* context)
    
    TEEC_Result TEEC_OpenSession (
    	TEEC_Context* context,
    	TEEC_Session* session,
    	const TEEC_UUID* destination,
    	uint32_t connectionMethod,
    	const void* connectionData,
    	TEEC_Operation* operation,
    	uint32_t* returnOrigin)
    
    void TEEC_CloseSession (
    	TEEC_Session* session)
    
    TEEC_Result TEEC_InvokeCommand(
    	TEEC_Session* session,
    	uint32_t commandID,
    	TEEC_Operation* operation,
    	uint32_t* returnOrigin)

In principle the commands are called in this order:

.. code-block:: c

    TEEC_InitializeContext(...)
    TEEC_OpenSession(...)
    TEEC_InvokeCommand(...)
    TEEC_CloseSession(...)
    TEEC_FinalizeContext(...)

It is not uncommon that ``TEEC_InvokeCommand`` is called several times in row
when the session has been established.

For a complete example, please see chapter **5.2 Example 1: Using the TEE
Client API** in the GlobalPlatform TEE Client API Specification_ v1.0.

.. _tee_internal_core_api:

TEE Internal Core API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Internal Core API is the API that is exposed to the Trusted Applications
running in the secure world. The TEE Internal API consists of four major parts:

1. Trusted Storage API for Data and Keys
2. Cryptographic Operations API
3. Time API
4. Arithmetical API

Examples / usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Calling the Internal Core API is done in the same way as described above using
Client API. The best place to find information how this should be done is in
the TEE Internal Core API Specification_ v1.1.2 which contains many examples of
how to call the various APIs. One can also have a look at the examples in the
optee_examples_ git.

Secure Element API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. note::
    It's been a long time since this feature was tested. Most likely things will
    **not** work. There are no plans on updating this at the moment. But if
    there is anyone out there interested in this willing to spend time on this,
    it would of course be appreciated.

A ``Secure Element (SE)`` is a tamper-resistant platform (typically a one chip
secure microcontroller) capable of securely hosting applications and their
confidential and cryptographic data (e.g. key management) in accordance with
the rules and security requirements set forth by a set of well-identified
trusted authorities. Simplified speaking, SE is a secure platform that can run
application (called Applet) on it. In order to communicate with Applet, we need
a transport interface.

SE can be implemented via one of the following technologies

    - Embedded SE (accessed via platform dependent interface, unremovable)
    - Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC, accessed via SIM interface)
    - Advanced secure MicroSD (accessed via sdio/mmc interface)

Which means the physical interface between application processor (AP) and SE
can be quite different. GlobalPlatform tries to remove this gap and defined a
standard transport API called ``Secure Element API`` to cover those different
physical transport layer protocols. SE can be accessed directly in TEE, or
indirectly accessed via REE. In later case, a *secure channel* is needed to
ensure the data stream is not hijacked in REE. (For secure channel, we may
leverage TZC-400_ to create a secure memory that is not accessible in REE). To
understand SE API, you need to understand the following terms:

    - **Trusted Application (TA)**: An application execute in Trust Execution
      Environment (TEE), which is the initiator of SE API.
    
    - **Applet**: Applications that run on smartcard OS. Secure Element API
      defines the method to communicate between host application (in our case,
      TA) and Applet.
    
    - **Service**: A service can be used to retrieve all SE readers available
      in the system, it also provides a service to create a session from TA to
      a specific Reader.
    
    - **Session**: It maintains the connection between TA and a specific
      Reader. Different TAs can have a session opened on the same reader. It is
      SE manager's responsibility to demux the request from different TAs. Upon
      a session is opened by a TA, the card is power-up and ready to accept
      commands.
    
    - **Reader**: It is an abstraction to describe the transport interface
      between the system and SEs. You can imagine that a SD card slot is a
      Reader connected with assd. A ril daemon can be another read to talk with
      UICC cards. Even embedded SE should have a (virtual) Reader attached to
      it.
    
    - **Logical Channel**: It is used by host application (in our case, a TA)
      to communicate with applets on the smartcard. [GlobalPlatform Card
      Specification] defines maximum 20 logical channels, numbered from 0~19.
      Channel number 0 is so-called ``Basic logical channel``, or in short,
      ``Basic channel``. A channel can be opened or closed by a host
      application. It is the smartcard OS's responsibility to manage the state
      of each logical channel. Basic channel is always open and cannot be
      closed. A channel must select an applet, which means the command passed
      through the channel will be processed by the selected applet.
      GlobalPlatform requires a default applet must be selected on basic
      channel after system reset. Host application can select different applet
      by issuing a ``SELECT command`` on basic channel. Other logical channels
      (numbered 1~19) can be opened with or without a given ``Application
      Identifier`` (AID). If AID is not given, the applet selected on basic
      channel will be selected on the just opened logical channel.
    
    - **MultiSelectable or Non-MultiSelectable**: An applet can be
      MultiSelectable or Non-MultiSelectable. For a Non-MultiSelectable applet,
      it can only be selected by one channel, further ``SELECT command`` on
      another channel that is targeting to the applet will fail.
      MultiSelectable applet can be selected by multiple channels, the applet
      can decide maximum number of channels it is willing to accept.

Design
~~~~~~ 

    - **Manager** `core/include/tee/se/manager.h`_: This component manages all
      Readers on the system. It should provide reader interface for the Reader
      developers to register their own Reader instance. (In the case of
      [JavaCard Simulator], we should have [PC/SC Passthru Reader] to talk with
      simulator) It also provides an interface for client to get ``reader
      handle`` on the system.
    
    - **Reader** `core/include/tee/se/reader.h`_: It provides the operations that
      can be applied on a ``reader handle``. Just like get reader properties
      and create session to a reader. Itâ€™s also responsible for routing an
      operation(open, transmit...etc) to a specific Reader implementation.
    
    - **Protocol** (core/include/tee/se/{protocol.h,aid.h,apdu.h}): This module
      implements the *ISO7816 transport layer* protocol that is used to talk
      with smartcard. It relies on operations provided by Reader to transmit
      *Application Protocol Data Unit* (APDU, refer to ISO7816-4_) to a
      specific SE.
    
    - **Session** `core/include/tee/se/session.h`_: It provides the operations
      that can be applied on a session. Just like open basic or logical
      channel, and transmit APDU on the session. It relies on protocol layer to
      create logical, basic channel and transmit APDU.
    
    - **Channel** `core/include/tee/se/channel.h`_: It provides the operations
      that can be applied on a channel. Like transmit an APDU on the channel,
      select next applet. It relies on protocol module to select AID, and
      session module to transport APDU.
    
    - **Reader** interface `core/include/tee/se/reader/interface.h`_: The
      abstract layer used to implement a specific Reader instance, a set of
      operations need to be implemented to support a new Reader.
    
        - ``open()``: Triggered when the first session is connected, the Reader
          should be powered on and reset. Doing initialization. Detect SE is
          present or not.

        - ``close()``: Triggered when the last session to the Reader has been
          closed. The Reader can be powered down in this method.

        - ``get_properties()``: Get properties of the Reader. Something like
          the Reader is exclusive to TEE or not. SE is present...etc.

        - ``get_atr()``: Get ATR message from the Reader. ATR is defined in
          ISO7816-3, and it is the message report by SE to describe the ability
          of SE.

        - ``transmit()``: Transmit an APDU through the Reader which SE attached
          to.
